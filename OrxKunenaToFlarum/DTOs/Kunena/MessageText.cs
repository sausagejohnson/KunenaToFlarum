//(4, 'Hey Loops,\r\n\r\nFirst post, great! ;)\r\n\r\nSo as for your project, you\\''ll have of course full support from my side.\r\n\r\nBtw, for GPLed sprites, I found somes sprites released under this license, but I\\''m not sure if the library contains space ship or asteroids! =)\r\nMaybe it\\''d be an opportunity to make a little shift in the original theme! =D\r\n\r\nAnyway, right now I\\''m under the same impression than if I were yelling out loud in a room where there\\''s only the two of us! -_-\r\n\r\nHopefully the community will grow soon with the next release! One can only hope! =)'),
